# Cactus Mania Website

I built a website for a fictional cactus blog to practice some advanced Sass layout and animation techniques. The goal was to build it completely in HTML and Sass with no JavaScript, however a very small script needed to be included to add some functionality to the navigational menu. Other than that, 99% of the animation and functionality has been implemented with Sass.
